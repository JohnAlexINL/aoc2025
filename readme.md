# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo will contain my attempts at the AoC2025 challenges. In accordance with the AoC policies, the _inputs_ and _prompts_ will not be included in this repo, and to reproduce the outputs from the included source, you'll need to re-supply data from the challenges themselves.

### Tooling

I'll be doing this in C, 
specifically C89/C99.
I have access to the C Standard Library,
a terminal, and an editor with syntax highlighting.

### Additional Challenge

I think once I solve a problem, I will go back through a second time and solve again with an added caveat; the second time has to be in a _language I don't know_. Those might include;

- C# (`mcs` + `mono`)
- Rust ()
- Lisp
- COBOL
- Forth
- Haskell

And additionally, I am not allowed to use _tutorials_, instead I'll learn the syntax and general paradigm/flow of these languages by browsing GitHub for repos that use them.
